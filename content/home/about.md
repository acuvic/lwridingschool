We have just moved to these premises but the owner and principal tutor, Tayla has been teaching for many years and has gained a reputation of giving top class instructions. She teaches all ages from the total beginner to keen competitors and she competes at an advanced level herself.

The facilities are second to none, consisting of purpose build stables, a spacious arena and paddocks with easy access and parking.

There is an excellent selection of horses to suit the type and level of riding so that people of all abilities will feel comfortable.
