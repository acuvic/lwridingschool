&lt;p&gt;Tayla is a fantastic instructor! Very knowledgeable and patient with her clients; never makes you feel unaccomplished in your own abilities. Works with horse and rider to get the best out of your partnership. Add to that fun, fun and more fun - highly recommend Tayla üê¥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always love my lessons with Tayla-especially jumping lessons; she knows exactly when I need pushing and is so patient. Super-knowledgeable and gives lots of ideas of homework I can do with my horse so we‚Äôre progressing. I‚Äôd definitely recommend her!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
